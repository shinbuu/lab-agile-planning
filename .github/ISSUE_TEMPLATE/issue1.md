### 
**As a** data owner  
**I need** to encrypt my local data using homomorphic encryption before sending it to the cloud  
**So that** my sensitive information remains confidential during cloud computation  

### Details and Assumptions
* –ò—Å–ø–æ–ª—å–∑—É–µ—Ç—Å—è –±–∏–±–ª–∏–æ—Ç–µ–∫–∞ Microsoft SEAL (CKKS/BFV)  
* –ö–ª—é—á–∏ –≥–µ–Ω–µ—Ä–∏—Ä—É—é—Ç—Å—è –ª–æ–∫–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ (pk, sk)  
* –®–∏—Ñ—Ä–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–µ –≤—ã–ø–æ–ª–Ω—è–µ—Ç—Å—è –¥–æ –ø–µ—Ä–µ–¥–∞—á–∏ –Ω–∞ —Å–µ—Ä–≤–µ—Ä  

### Acceptance Criteria
```gherkin
Given the user has local data
When they select a file and click "Encrypt"
Then the ciphertext is created and stored locally or uploaded securely
